### Update driver

Currently there are two Chrome drivers saved at `drivers/` for two operating systems (i.e. Mac and Windows). 

Depending on what operating system and version of Chrome you are working with, you may have to [redownload the appropriate chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and save it in directory `drivers/`. 

To find out what version of Chrome you need, open a window in Chrome and go to *Help* -> *About Google Chrome*

### Scrape listings
